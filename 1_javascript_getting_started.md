## 1. TypeScript: The Big Picture
### 1.1. Course Overview

It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language.

### 1.2. How TypeScript Can Help

TypeScript requires JavaScript. It uses JS as a baseline. TS is not a unique language.

**The Problem With JavaScript**

Developing complex applications with JS is challenging. **TS compiles/transpile to JS.** We get readable JS from compile operation.

**How TypeScript Helps: Static Typing**

JS is very dynamic and this causes unpredictable behavior in large scale projects. JS is an interpreted language. TS brings type, increases consistency.

**How TypeScript Helps: Organization**

TS makes easier to manage large codebase. 
- Class: Object oriented classes
- Namespace: We don't want everything globally available.
- Modules: Gives scope control.
- Interfaces: Interfaces. Expected methods and properties.
- 

TypeScript vs ECMAScript Class Compatibility
- Recent ES2015 standard adds class to JS, TypeScript classes supports even back to ES3(1999). Also, TS is always aligned with future ECMAScript proposals.

**How TypeScript Helps: Tooling**

Static type analysis, we get deep analyze results.
- static type analysis
- many "instant" errors
- detect unused data / unreachable code
- source maps - debug directly in TypeScript
